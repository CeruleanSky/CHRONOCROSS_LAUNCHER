CHRONOCROSS_LAUNCHER
Silent Launcher replacement for Chrono Cross

Compile with `gcc -mwindows CHRONOCROSS_LAUNCHER.c -o CHRONOCROSS_LAUNCHER.exe`  
Replace(after backing up) CHRONOCROSS_LAUNCHER.exe in your Chrono Cross installation directory.

Running it will only launch Chrono Cross, not Radical Dreamers, and also it allows you run CHRONOCROSS.exe directly as well.
